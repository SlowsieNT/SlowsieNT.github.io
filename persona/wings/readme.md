## 2w1

An enneagram 2w1 is inclined to help people but is more concerned with providing the proper help that meshes with your morals.

## 3w2

Enneagram 3w2s are charming and persistent, making excellent entertainers or salespeople. They crave attention from the people around them, but they can get angry or aggressive if they don’t receive it. Though they want to be recognized for their achievements, they still help others.
3w4

An enneagram 3w4 cares more about staying authentic to yourself than a 3w2. This can feel confusing to them because their dominant type is more of a social chameleon, while your wing type values being seen as unique. They may pretend to be someone for a crowd but feel conflicted because they know it is not authentic.
